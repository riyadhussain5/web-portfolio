    <h3>World Class Corruption Planning House</h3>
    <p>"This is the Hawa Bhaban," a CNG-run three-wheeler driver commented, slowing down his vehicle in front of the house on Sunday. A woman popped out her head through the vehicle and kept staring at the house as long as she could, as if in an attempt to understand the mystery.
        Though the three-storey house was rented in 2000 as the political office of the BNP chairperson with an aim to turn it into a centre for political research and training for the party, it ultimately turned into the "centre of corruption" and "control room of extortion", political analysts say.</p>

            <p>In the wake of widespread criticism of the activities, several senior minister and policymakers of BNP desired for closing Hawa Bhaban in 2004 saying "half of the blames" the government was facing would go then.
                In the Tk 1 crore extortion case filed against Tarique on the day of his arrest, Amin Ahmed, a businessman who got ticket as a BNP candidate from a Noakhali constituency for the cancelled January 22 election, mentioned that Tarique called him to Hawa Bhaban and demanded the money, which he complied later.</p>
